#### New features

- **Network Bundles**: Previously, OpenStreetMap street network data (OSM) was uploaded during region creation. Now, OSM is uploaded along with GTFS while creating a Network Bundle. This change allows you to compare scenarios built on different OSM within a single region. When creating a Network Bundle, you also have the option to re-use previously uploaded OSM and GTFS in that region. _Note: previously created Network Bundles use the OSM that was uploaded for their region._
- **Regional Analysis Status**: A running regional analysis now shows additional information, including a remaining time estimate and how many servers in Conveyal's cloud compute cluster are processing the analysis.
- **Map**: Dimmed the color of water features on the basemap to improve isochrone visualizations
- **Error Handling**: Clearer displays of error messages
