### Regional Analysis Display

We improved regional analysis result maps.

- Locations with access to 0 opportunities are now transparent.
- Comparisons have an improved color scheme and legend, with blue for areas with increases in accessibility, red for areas with decreases in accessibility, and transparency for areas with 0 or small changes in accessibility.

To calculate the color breaks for a Regional Analysis we use the [CKMeans](https://simplestatistics.org/docs/#ckmeans) clustering algorithm on a randomly sampled subset of data. This algorithm helps generate clusters quickly.

### Routing Engine

The recommended version of R5 is now v4.8.0. This version:

- Follows the standard definition of percentiles more closely when summarizing travel times (see [#563](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/563)). **Relative to past versions of R5, accessibility results for a given travel time and percentile will be slightly higher due to this change**. If you need to use past routing engine versions for consistency with past analyses, you can still enter version numbers (e.g. v4.7.0) in the analysis panel.
- Uses Java 11 and updates various dependencies (see [#556](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/556)).
- Speeds up the process of connecting transit stops to destinations (see [#564](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/564)).
- Allows you to create frequency entries in any order. Previous R5 versions would return an error if frequency entries were not ordered by their start time (see [#569](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/pull/569)).

### User Interface

- Updated method for isochrone display and download, removing zero-area artifacts that inhibited geoprocessing
- Improved interface with new component library [chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) and small changes (e.g. showing scenario names in addition to numbers in modification details)

### User Manual

- Made terminology more consistent throughout and expanded the glossary
- Updated screenshots and instructions for interface elements
- Moved materials giving an overview of a feature ahead of any instructions for using it.
