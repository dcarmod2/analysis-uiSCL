McPherson is a small city in Kansas with no transit. It's a test case for importing routes via shapefile. A shapefile is provided and the OSM data will be fetched from Overpass by the download script download.sh in the parent directory. The GTFS needed to create the project can be taken from another region e.g. the small feed for Vancouver, Washington's CTRAN.
