# Analysis UI

This is the user interface component of [Conveyal Analysis](http://conveyal.com/analysis), which allows users to create public transport scenarios and evaluate them in terms of cumulative opportunities accessibility indicators.

Please note that Conveyal does not provide technical support for third-party deployments of Analysis. We provide paid subscriptions to a cloud-based deployment of this system which performs these complex calculations hundreds of times faster using a compute cluster. This project is open source primarily to ensure transparency and reproducibility in public planning and decision making processes, and in hopes that it may help researchers, students, and potential collaborators to understand and build upon our methodology.
